# Circle Packing Optimization

This repository provides a computational framework for solving the circle packing problem within a domain. Given a specified number of circles, the code determines the optimal arrangement that maximizes the radius of the circles while ensuring that:

- No circles overlap.
- All circles are entirely contained within the container.

A central purpose of this project is to study and compare the performance of different solvers for global optimization. The solution process leverages mathematical optimization techniques and integrates with the AMPL modeling language and a variety of nonlinear and global optimization solvers. This enables systematic experimentation with solver capabilities, solution quality, and computational efficiency.

The results include both the optimal circle positions and a visualization of the packing configuration.

This project is intended for research, educational, and demonstration purposes in the fields of optimization and computational geometry.
